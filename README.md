# Overview

This is a web app that will be used to provide various problems for students to solve. The user is prompted to choose a set of questions that they would like to solve from three different categories- Math, Science, and History. 

# Functionality

When the user selects a category that they want to study from they are then redirected to a page that will displayed a random question that is chosen from a set of 30 questions. The user will then select the answer that they believe is correct and will then either click the next button or the submit button. If the next button is clicked then the user will then get another random question that they can then answer, if they click the submit button then they will be shown the results page that displays if they got their selected answers correct. After 10 questions are answered it will automatically redirect to the results page and show the user what they got right and what they got wrong.
